Whats Server ?
A server is a computer or system that provides resources, data, services, or programs to other 
computers, known as clients, over a network.

We can use our computer as server and we dont need AWS, but there are some limitations
    - Limited ram space
    - Limited storage space
    - Always up and running
    - can't scale 
    - Security issues
    - We use a local internet provider, they dont guarantee your IP, But AWS guarantee you a IP.

AWS has a big data centers in multiple regions.
In AWS we can scale the storage space

You are creating a http server using node js 
 - you are creating a applications that can handle user requests.

Client-Server Architecture
Client-server architecture is a computing model where multiple clients (remote computers) 
request and receive services from a centralized server (a powerful computer). The server hosts, 
delivers, and manages most of the resources and services to be consumed by the client. This model 
is commonly used in web applications, where the server hosts the website, and clients access it 
through their web browsers.

TCP / IP connections ?
TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) is a set of communication protocols used 
to connect network devices on the internet. TCP ensures reliable data transmission between 
devices, while IP handles addressing and routing the data packets to their destination.

Types of servers 
1. HTTP server (Hyper text transfer protocol)
2. FTP server (File Transfer protocol)
3. SMTP server (Simple maail Transfer protocol)

When we talk about Node, we can talk about the HTTPS server in web server

Server Listents to the request

Pockets : Data are send in small chunks to the server called as Pockets
Server receives the packets and reassemble them into the original data.

We can create multiple of http server inside a server, but you would need a different port number 
eg : (Localhost:8080);

Port number is a needed so that other people can connect to the your applications.

What is DNS?
DNS (Domain Name System) is a system that translates human-readable domain names (like www.example.com) into IP addresses (like 192.0.2.1) that computers use to identify each other on the network. It acts like a phonebook for the internet, allowing users to access websites using easy-to-remember names instead of numerical IP addresses.

A server can talk / connect with the another server.

Sockets vs WebSockets
Sockets:
- Low-level communication endpoints used for sending and receiving data between devices over a network.
- Can be used with various protocols like TCP and UDP.
- Typically used for traditional client-server communication.

WebSockets:
- A protocol providing full-duplex communication channels over a single TCP connection.
- Designed for real-time web applications.
- Allows for persistent, bidirectional communication between a client (usually a web browser) and a server.
